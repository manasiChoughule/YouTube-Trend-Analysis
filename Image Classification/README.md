# Image Classifier for Movie Characters

A major potter head over here! I have always wondered how diifferent the characters looked over the years. I belive a neural network would be able to learn the facial changes each characters had gone through. But, I wanted to experiment with supervised classification algorithms and check if they would also identify the characters. 

This project classifies the movie characters from their images using various classification machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Randome Forest, and Logistic Regression. 
It uses Flask framework to connect to the machine learning model.

## Dataset

For this project, I have curated a image dataset of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy. I have web scraped to collect around 500 images of each character. I made sure to collect sample images of different ages to test my experiment.
