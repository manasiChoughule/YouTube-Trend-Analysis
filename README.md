## Introduction

Welcome to the YouTube Trend Analysis project! In this insightful data exploration, we delve into the fascinating world of YouTube's trending videos to uncover patterns and shifts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset collected using YouTube API, offering us a unique opportunity to understand how global events influenced user behaviors on the platform.

## Objective

Our primary goal is to understand the impact of COVID-19 on YouTube trends and to dissect the key factors contributing to video popularity. By analyzing view counts, categories, description lengths, and more, we aim to derive meaningful insights that shed light on user preferences and content creators' strategies.

## Key Questions Explored

### 1. How did COVID-19 affect YouTube trends?

We dive into view count trends before, during, and after the pandemic. By comparing the minimum, maximum, and distribution of view counts, we aim to reveal any significant shifts in user engagement patterns.

### 2. What changes occurred in trending video categories?

We examine shifts in the most-watched video categories. Did the pandemic influence user preferences, causing a reshuffle in the categories that dominated the trending list?

### 3. Does video description length correlate with views?

We analyze the relationship between video description lengths and view counts. Did viewer behaviors change during the pandemic, leading to variations in the preferred description lengths?

### 4. How consistent are tag preferences?

By identifying the most common tags before and after the pandemic, we aim to uncover any shifts in content themes and strategies adopted by creators to appeal to changing audience preferences.

### 5. Did COVID-19 alter video longevity in trending lists?

We explore how the duration a video spends on the trending list changed during and after the pandemic. Are videos trending for longer or shorter durations now?
